### What is a System?
*A system is a regularly interacting or interdependent group of units forming an integrated whole.*

Input -> Process -> Output -> Feedback -> Input (...)


### Change Management
- Natural progression of the technology ~ natural development of new systems
- New system is developed as a result of a problem, or replace an older system


>What is Change Management?

>What is the need for change management?

Without effective change management, there may be serious issues in systems. The new system may stop functioning, may not function properly or may contain problems that become difficult and costly to fix.

Change management...
1. ...accomplishes change in the most efficient manner while minimizing the impact on an organization
2. ...provides training and support for staff
3. ...ensures that proper planning, designing, and testing stages are proposed
4. ...lowers the total cost of IT services.


***Moore's Law:*** Processor speeds, or overall processing power for computers will double every two years.


***Succesful Change*** should...
1. ...benefit the management and the aims of the company 
2. ...monitor risks, dependencies, costs, return of investment (ROI), disbenefits and cultural issues affecting the aim of the company.
3. ...monitor counter resistance from the employees of companies and persuade them to change
4. ...provide personal counseling to ease any change-related fears

### Context the System is Planned
