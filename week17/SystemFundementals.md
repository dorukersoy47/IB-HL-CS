### What is a System?
*A system is a regularly interacting or interdependent group of units forming an integrated whole.*

Input -> Process -> Output -> Feedback -> Input (...)
<br></br>


### Change Management
- Natural progression of the technology ~ natural development of new systems
- New system is developed as a result of a problem, or replace an older system
<br></br>

>What is Change Management?
- Change management is the movement towards a *future desired state.*
- In the area of technology, change management refers to a set of standardized processes for keeping all IT (Information Technology) systems in good working order.
- Change management may occur in *hardware, software, data, all documentation and procedures associated with running, support and maintenance of live systems.*
<br></br>

>What is the need for change management?

Without effective change management, there may be serious issues in systems. The new system may stop functioning, may not function properly or may contain problems that become difficult and costly to fix.
<br></br>

Change management...
1. ...accomplishes change in the most efficient manner while minimizing the impact on an organization
2. ...provides training and support for staff
3. ...ensures that proper planning, designing, and testing stages are proposed
4. ...lowers the total cost of IT services.
<br></br>

***Moore's Law:*** Processor speeds, or overall processing power for computers will double every two years.
<br></br>

***Succesful Change*** should...
1. ...benefit the management and the aims of the company 
2. ...monitor risks, dependencies, costs, return of investment (ROI), disbenefits and cultural issues affecting the aim of the company.
3. ...monitor counter resistance from the employees of companies and persuade them to change
4. ...provide personal counseling to ease any change-related fears
<br></br>

### Context the System is Planned
***Computer System Analysts*** create new computer systems by studying an organization's current computer systems and procedures and making recommendations to help the organization operate more efficiently and effectively.

- They bring business and information technology (IT) together by understanding the needs and limitations of both.
- They run the feasibility study for the new system implementation.
<br></br>

***Feasibility*** is the measure of how suitable the new system will be to the company.

>Types of Feasibility

1. *Technical feasibility* is asking whether the existing technology is sufficient to implement the proposed system
2. *Economic feasibility* is checking the cost effectiveness of the proposed system
3. *Legal feasibility* is checking against conflicts between the proposed system and any regulations/laws
4. *Operational feasibility* is looking for existing organizational practices and procedures and understanding whether they are sufficient to support the maintenance and operations of the new system.
5. *Schedule feasibility* is about how long will the new system implementation take

<br></br>

***System Manager*** should...
1. ...appreciate the extent and limitations of the new system

2. ...consider organizational issues and environments
    - user roles, underlying technologies, etc.

3. ...explain why the change is taking place, the benefits of successful change 
    - what is in it for the company

4. ...explain/determine the details of the change 
    - when? where? who is involved? how much will it cost? Etc. â†’ budget, time, scope

### Compatibility Issues Resulting from Situations Including Legacy Systems or Business Mergers

***Legacy systems*** are outdated computer systems, programming languages or application software that are used instead of available upgraded versions.

- A legacy system is often still in use because its data cannot be changed to newer or standard formats, or its application programs cannot be upgraded.
