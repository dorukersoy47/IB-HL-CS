### What is a System?
*A system is a regularly interacting or interdependent group of units forming an integrated whole.*

Input -> Process -> Output -> Feedback -> Input (...)
<br></br>


### Change Management
- Natural progression of the technology ~ natural development of new systems
- New system is developed as a result of a problem, or replace an older system
<br></br>

##### What is Change Management?
- Change management is the movement towards a *future desired state.*
- In the area of technology, change management refers to a set of standardized processes for keeping all IT (Information Technology) systems in good working order.
- Change management may occur in *hardware, software, data, all documentation and procedures associated with running, support and maintenance of live systems.*
<br></br>

##### What is the need for change management?

Without effective change management, there may be serious issues in systems. The new system may stop functioning, may not function properly or may contain problems that become difficult and costly to fix.
<br></br>

***Change management...***
1. ...accomplishes change in the most efficient manner while minimizing the impact on an organization
2. ...provides training and support for staff
3. ...ensures that proper planning, designing, and testing stages are proposed
4. ...lowers the total cost of IT services.
<br></br>

***Moore's Law:*** Processor speeds, or overall processing power for computers will double every two years.
<br></br>

***Succesful Change*** should...
1. ...benefit the management and the aims of the company 
2. ...monitor risks, dependencies, costs, return of investment (ROI), disbenefits and cultural issues affecting the aim of the company.
3. ...monitor counter resistance from the employees of companies and persuade them to change
4. ...provide personal counseling to ease any change-related fears
<br></br>

### Context the System is Planned
***Computer System Analysts*** create new computer systems by studying an organization's current computer systems and procedures and making recommendations to help the organization operate more efficiently and effectively.

- They bring business and information technology (IT) together by understanding the needs and limitations of both.
- They run the feasibility study for the new system implementation.
<br></br>

***Feasibility*** is the measure of how suitable the new system will be to the company.

Types of Feasibility:

1. *Technical feasibility* is asking whether the existing technology is sufficient to implement the proposed system
2. *Economic feasibility* is checking the cost effectiveness of the proposed system
3. *Legal feasibility* is checking against conflicts between the proposed system and any regulations/laws
4. *Operational feasibility* is looking for existing organizational practices and procedures and understanding whether they are sufficient to support the maintenance and operations of the new system.
5. *Schedule feasibility* is about how long will the new system implementation take

<br></br>

***System Manager*** should...
1. ...appreciate the extent and limitations of the new system

2. ...consider organizational issues and environments
    - user roles, underlying technologies, etc.

3. ...explain why the change is taking place, the benefits of successful change 
    - what is in it for the company

4. ...explain/determine the details of the change 
    - when? where? who is involved? how much will it cost? Etc. → budget, time, scope,
<br></br>

### Compatibility Issues Resulting from Situations Including Legacy Systems or Business Mergers

***Legacy systems*** are outdated computer systems, programming languages or application software that are used instead of available upgraded versions.

- A legacy system is often still in use because its data cannot be changed to newer or standard formats, or its application programs cannot be upgraded.
<br></br>

***Things to Consider in Legacy Systems***
***Compatibility Issues***

Compatibility is the capacity for two systems to work together without having to be altered to do so.
<br></br>

##### Questions to Ask

- Will legacy software run on new hardware?
- Is the format of the legacy system data compatible with new software?
- Can the legacy system be used with new technologies?

<br></br>

#####Examples of Compatibilty Issues:
- The cost of maintaining an older system can be higher than maintaining a more updated version. The staff might not be familiar with such an outdated version of the system.
- Tech support may no longer be available.
- The data in the current system might not be compatible with newer systems and conversion may not be possible.
- Legacy systems are usually more vulnerable to security threats due to lack of security patches.
<br></br>

***Lack of Security***

Security is the defense of digital information and IT assets against internal and external, malicious and accidental threats.

##### Questions to Ask
- How much the legacy system is open to security attacks?

##### Examples of Security Issues:
- Legacy systems may have vulnerabilities in older operating systems or applications due to lack of security patches being available or applied. 

- There can also be production configurations that cause security problems. These issues can put the legacy system at risk of being compromised by attackers or knowledgeable insiders.

<br></br>

***Virtual Machines and Emilators***
- One solution to using legacy systems is using virtual machine, which creates a virtual ‘computer’ running inside a window, like a regular application program. This virtual computer is independent of the host computer and can be paused, shut down, restarted, and modified at will. It runs its own operating system and software, independent of the host computer. 

- If the legacy system requires hardware which is significantly different from the host computer (for example, it requires a different processor or mainframe hardware), a virtual machine may not be enough, and a program called emulator may be needed.  An emulator is a software recreation of an entire system’s hardware including its processor and associated hardware. 
<br></br>

***Business Mergers***
Business mergers are transactions in which the ownership of companies, other business organizations or their operating units are transferred or combined.
<br></br>

- When two companies merge, there will be things to consider about merging  the computer systems as well. The systems used by the companies may be very different. This can result in time and money being spent converting one system to another. 
- It may be that two systems will continue to run independently which may cause problems in terms of data redundancy. If systems are to be replaced then this will have a cost in terms of purchasing new hardware and software and retraining staff to use the new system.
<br></br>

##### Things to Consider in the IT System in Business Mergers
- Is the data from each company compatible?
- How is the data from each system going to be integrated?
- Transformation of data from one system to another.
- Companies may not be using same application software.
- Businesses may not have same change management policies.
- Integration of newer systems may be a complicated process as the two systems may have completely different technologies
- Programming language differences
