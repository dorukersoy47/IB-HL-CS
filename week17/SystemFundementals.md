>What is a System?
*A system is a regularly interacting or interdependent group of units forming an integrated whole.*
Input -> Process -> Output -> Feedback -> Input (...)


### Change Management
- Natural progression of the technology ~ natural development of new systems
- New system is developed as a result of a problem, or replace an older system

>What is Change Management?
- Change management is the movement towards a *future desired state.*
- In the area of technology, change management refers to a set of standardized processes for keeping all IT (Information Technology) systems in good working order.
- Change management may occur in *hardware, software, data, all documentation and procedures associated with running, support and maintenance of live systems.*

>What is the need for change management?
1. New applications may not be compatible with old software
2. Making the application more efficent
3. Having problems finding work-force in the old technology (Banks using cobol)

>*Moore's Law:* Processor speeds, or overall processing power for computers will double every two years.
